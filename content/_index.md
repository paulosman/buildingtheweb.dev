title: "Building the Web"
description: "Ideas that Built the Web"
---

The internet didn't emerge from a single grand vision. It was the cumulative result of people bumping into constraints and engineering solutions. Some of those solutions turned out to be particularly load-bearing: concepts so fundamental that we take them for granted today.

**Building the Web** is about those ideas and how they evolved. Each chapter starts with a real constraint that engineers faced, traces the solution they invented, and follows that idea as it scaled, sometimes beyond anything its creators imagined.

From load balancers to caching layers, from CGI scripts to content delivery networks - these are the building blocks that turned a research network into the infrastructure that runs the modern world. This is the story of how they got here.
